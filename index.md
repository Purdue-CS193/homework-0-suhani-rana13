## Suhani's First CS193 Homework!

Hi I'm suhani! I am 18 years old and am a Computer science major. Hopefully if things go well this year, I can start to pursue a minor in 
astronomy next year!

These are my three favorite things about CS193:
```markdown
1. How easygoing the class is
2. How helpful the material is for my CS180 class
3. How helpful the instructors are



Below I listed some of my favorite things and hobbies:



-Volleyball
-baking
-reading
-skateboarding (I'm not the best though)
-rock climbing
-going to the gym
